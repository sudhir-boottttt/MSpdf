# Getting Started

Welcome to MSPDF! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## What is MSPDF?

MSPDF is a free, open-source, privacy-first PDF toolkit that runs **entirely in your browser**. Your files never leave your device—all processing happens locally using WebAssembly (WASM) technology.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Hosted Version

### Option 2: Self-Host with Docker

```bash
# Pull and run the Docker image
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 ghcr.io/alam00000/MSpdf:latest

# Or use Docker Compose
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alam00000/MSpdf/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Option 3: Build from Source
