## Limitations

::: warning Large Files
Vercel's serverless functions have a 50MB limit. Since MSPDF is a static site, this shouldn't affect you, but WASM modules are large (~100MB total). Ensure they're served from the `/public` folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Timeout

If builds timeout, try:

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

### 404 on Refresh

Add a `vercel.json` for SPA routing:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```
