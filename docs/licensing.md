## When Do You Need a Commercial License?

| Use Case                                    | License Required       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Open-source project with public source code | AGPL-3.0 (Free)        |
| Internal company tool (not distributed)     | AGPL-3.0 (Free)        |
| Proprietary/closed-source application       | **Commercial License** |
| SaaS product without source code disclosure | **Commercial License** |
| Redistributing without AGPL compliance      | **Commercial License** |

## Delivery & Licensing Model

- **No license key is required or provided.** MSPDF intentionally does not use license keys to streamline deployment and reduce operational friction for users.
- Upon purchase, users receive a ZIP archive containing the complete MSPDF source code and binaries.
- The source code provided is identical to the code published in our public open-source repository.

## Important Notice on Third-Party Components

::: info AGPL Components — Pre-configured via CDN
MSPDF **does not bundle** AGPL-licensed processing libraries in its source code. These components are loaded at runtime from CDN URLs that are **pre-configured by default** — all features work out of the box with zero setup.

| Component       | License  | Status                 |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| **PyMuPDF**     | AGPL-3.0 | Pre-configured via CDN |
| **Ghostscript** | AGPL-3.0 | Pre-configured via CDN |
| **CoherentPDF** | AGPL-3.0 | Pre-configured via CDN |

WASM module URLs are configured via environment variables at build time (`.env.production`). The defaults point to jsDelivr CDN. For custom deployments (air-gapped, self-hosted), you can override via environment variables, Docker build args, or per-user via **Advanced Settings** in the UI.

See [Self-Hosting > WASM Configuration](/self-hosting/#wasm-configuration-agpl-components) for details.

This approach ensures:

- MSPDF's core code remains under its dual-license (AGPL-3.0 / Commercial)
- WASM binaries are loaded at runtime, not included in the source
- Clear compliance boundaries for commercial users
  :::

::: tip Commercial License & AGPL Features
The commercial license covers MSPDF's own code. If you configure and use AGPL components (PyMuPDF, Ghostscript, CoherentPDF), you must still comply with their respective AGPL-3.0 license terms, which may require source code disclosure if you distribute modified versions.

## FAQ

### Do I need a license key to use MSPDF?

No. MSPDF does not use license keys. The commercial license grants you legal rights to use the software in proprietary applications.

### Can I use MSPDF in my SaaS product?

Yes, with a commercial license. Without it, you must comply with AGPL-3.0, which requires you to make your full source code available to users.

### What about the AGPL components?

Components like CoherentPDF are licensed under AGPL v3 and remain under that license. The commercial license covers MSPDF's own code but does not override third-party AGPL obligations.

### How do I get an invoice?

Email [contact@MSpdf.com](mailto:contact@MSpdf.com) with your Ko-fi purchase confirmation, and we'll send an official invoice.
